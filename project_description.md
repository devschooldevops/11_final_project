## Project description

During the last 10 lessons you've learned thing or two about many technologies and now it's time to put that to the test. For this lesson you will pair up with 2 others to create a project that you will present in one week from now.

### Description

In this repository you will find a skeleton application written with python in the Flask framework. this should be your starting point. the goal of the project is to showcase what you've learned during these lessons, feel free to be creative and experiment or add additionals.
We expect you to use at least these technologies:
* git
* pipelines
* docker
* python

### Presentation

You will have 10 minutes to present your project, 




- scheleton of a REST API written in Python using Flask framework
- to implement: do a rest call to another API from the internet (any API) and parse/extract something from that response (eg.: find all deployments that have this and that)
- pack your application in Docker
- build the Docker image with pipelines (this implies having a VM in Azure configured as an agent to build)
- deploy it in the Cloud (Azure):
- deploy the docker image on another VM in Azure that has Docker installed
- deploy it as an Azure Function
- deploy it locally
- with plain Docker
- with k8s (minikube)
